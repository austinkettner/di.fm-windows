Now Playing showcases whatever is the currently playing channel in DI.FM. When no channel is currently active, then this should show the most recently played channel.

Favorite Channels lists out all of the channels the user has designated as a 'favorite'. Limited to displaying 3 items on the Main View.

###Channel View
A page used to show a selected channel and all important information related to each channel.
 
Now Playing showcases the currently playing song, and a Play/Pause button.

Prev/Next Buttons provide the user the ability to view other channels near Vocal Trance, this is alphabetically determined currently, but may evolve into a more dynamic/smarter system.

Track History is a section that simply lists the previous tracks that have played on this Channel, with the Arrow in the top Right of this section being clickable to load 5 even older tracks (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).
 
###Snap View
At any given time the user should be able to load a Snap View of DI.FM. This is simple a constrained view of the Channel and Main View, but should not limit functionality.
